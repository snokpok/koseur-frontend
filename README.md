# Koseur: Nightlife App for Vietnamese Bars, Clubs and Lounges
- I built this with two other friends over the summer as we were bored and wanted to build something that is novel and useful for Vietnamese people. Nightlife is a big thing in Vietnam so we built this app to put forth Vietnamese bars and clubs on a central platform for people to explore. Frontend was built with Next.js + Sass and backend was with the headless CMS Strapi which runs on Node.js, linked to a Postgres database.
